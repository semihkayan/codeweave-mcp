# CLAUDE.md

This file contains only what an agent cannot easily derive from code: architectural decisions and their reasons, non-obvious conventions, and cross-cutting rules. **Before changing anything, ask: "Can the agent figure this out easily by reading the code?" If yes, don't add it.**

## What this project is

MCP server that gives AI agents cheap, precise code understanding. Instead of dumping entire files into context, the agent queries local indexes (AST, call graph, type graph, vector search) and gets back only what it needs. All indexing is local and live — file watcher keeps everything current as code changes.

**Primary goal: AI agents should do higher-quality work on code, at lower cost.** Less token waste, more relevant context, better decisions. Every feature and improvement must serve this — if it doesn't help the agent work better or cheaper, it doesn't belong here.

## Build & Run

```bash
npm run build          # TypeScript → dist/
npm run dev            # Run with tsx (dev mode)
npm test               # vitest
```

## Architecture

Single-process Node.js MCP server. stdout is reserved for MCP protocol — never `console.log()`, use `logger` from `utils/logger.ts` (writes to `.code-context/server.log`).

### Layers

```
index.ts             → MCP shell: registerTool × 8, transport, shutdown
services.ts          → Composition root: ALL concrete instantiation here
tools/               → 8 tool handlers (thin orchestrators, interface-only deps)
core/                → Business logic behind interfaces
parsers/             → 7 language parsers (tree-sitter wrappers)
utils/               → Config, file I/O, git, logging, SQL escape
scripts/             → CLI tools (init, reindex, setup, check-docstrings)
types/index.ts       → Data types (FunctionRecord, VectorRow, CallGraphEntry, etc.)
types/interfaces.ts  → All interfaces
```

### Key design decisions

- **MCP connects after indexing** — `initializeWorkspaces()` runs first so tools are ready on first agent call. Embedding runs in the background after connect via `backgroundEmbed()`. Cached init takes <2s, well within MCP client timeout.
- **`ready` flag** — tools return `NOT_READY` error until init completes (`tool-utils.ts:checkReady()`).
- **ReindexOrchestrator** (`core/reindex-orchestrator.ts`) — single place for all reindex workflows (full, incremental, file-level, watcher). Tool handler and watcher both delegate to it.
- **Graph persistence** — call graph and type graph cached as JSON in `.code-context/`. Validated via index fingerprint (SHA-256 of file hashes). Mismatch → full rebuild.
- **Workspace isolation** — monorepo workspaces get separate AST index, call graph, type graph, LanceDB table. No cross-workspace relationships.

### Composition root (services.ts)

All concrete class instantiation is in `createServices()`. Tool handlers never import concrete classes — they receive `AppContext` which exposes only interfaces. To swap a component (e.g., LanceDB → Qdrant): change 1 line in `services.ts`.

## Rules

### SOLID

Follow SOLID principles in all changes. Concrete example: all language-specific knowledge (test markers, noise targets, builtin methods) lives in parser configs — never in tool handlers or core modules. Adding a language must not require modifying existing files beyond `registry.ts`.

### Language & project agnosticism

All heuristics must be structural (body size, param count, call graph centrality), never based on naming conventions (`get/set` prefix) or framework-specific paths (`/entity/`, `/controllers/`). Every change must work across all 7 supported languages and any project structure.

### Tool handlers

- **Never import from `core/` or `utils/`** — depend only on `AppContext` and `WorkspaceServices` interfaces
- **Keep thin** — orchestration logic belongs in services (e.g., `ReindexOrchestrator`), not handlers
- **Always use `textResponse()`** for responses
- **Follow the pattern:**

```typescript
export async function handleToolName(args: { ... }, ctx: AppContext) {
  const resolved = resolveWorkspaceOrError(ctx, args.workspace);
  if ("error" in resolved) return resolved.error;
  const ws = resolved.ws;
  // ... use ws.index, ws.callGraph, ctx.reindex, ctx.git, etc.
  return textResponse(result);
}
```

### Path conventions

- **FunctionRecord.id**: `"filePath::functionName"` (workspace-relative). `call-graph.ts:removeByFile` relies on this prefix format — don't change without updating graph cleanup.
- **FunctionRecord.filePath**: workspace-relative (e.g., `"src/core/search.ts"`)
- **Module path**: directory part of filePath, sourceRoot stripped (e.g., `"core"` not `"src/core"`)
- **Boundary rule**: `FunctionIndex` stores relative, `globSourceFiles` returns absolute, `FileWatcher` receives absolute. Convert at boundaries.

## Adding things

### New language parser

1. Create `src/parsers/{language}.ts` — implement 5 extract functions (`extractFunctions`, `extractCalls`, `extractImports`, `extractTypeRelationships`, `extractDocstring`) + metadata fields (`testDecorators`, `testImportPrefixes`, `noiseTargets`, `builtinMethods`, `noisePatterns`)
2. Export a `TreeSitterLanguageConfig`
3. Add to `PARSER_CONFIGS` in `src/parsers/registry.ts`
4. Add extensions to default config in `src/utils/config.ts`
5. Add `tree-sitter-{language}` dependency + override in `package.json`

### New tool

1. Add Zod schema in `src/tools/schemas.ts` — every param needs `.describe()` with examples
2. Create handler in `src/tools/{name}.ts` following the handler pattern
3. Register in `src/index.ts` — description must say WHEN and WHY to use the tool
4. Business logic goes in a service, not the handler

### New service

1. Define interface in `src/types/interfaces.ts`
2. Create implementation in `src/core/{name}.ts`
3. Add to `AppContext` or `WorkspaceServices` in `interfaces.ts`
4. Wire concrete class in `src/services.ts`

## Testing

`TestHarness` (`src/test-harness.ts`) — test MCP tools against any project. Three modes: `testAll()` runs 45 built-in generic tests, `run([...])` executes agent-defined cases in bulk, `call()` for single manual calls. `close()` releases memory (clear all index/graph maps).

`initializeWorkspaces()` in `services.ts` — shared init logic between MCP server and test harness. Returns `WorkspaceEmbedPlan` per workspace; MCP server passes this to `backgroundEmbed()`, test harness ignores it.

## Gotchas

- **tree-sitter CJS in ESM** — use `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, never dynamic `import()` for tree-sitter
- **LanceDB FTS** — `Index.fts()` may throw in some versions. Always try/catch.
- **LanceDB tag filtering** — delimiter format `",tag1,tag2,"` with `LIKE '%,tag1,%'` for exact match. Without leading/trailing commas, `LIKE '%pay%'` false-matches `payment`.
- **LanceDB vectors** — `Float32Array` must be converted to regular arrays before storage.
- **Embedding failures** — failed batches are skipped (not zero-filled). Unembedded functions get retried on next reindex.
- **LanceDB query API** — use `table.query().where(filter)` not `table.filter(filter)` (removed in newer versions). Always try/catch.
